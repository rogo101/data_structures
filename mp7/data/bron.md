Good Choice! You have decided to start the glorious process of becoming a basketball legend. Unfortunately, you are not young, tall, or skilled enough to be considered for the NBA. What do you do?

# none
Why even try? You are already the GOAT. And you're a billionaire too so who cares. 

# try
You have to try to thrive. Work on building your skill and minimizing the negative impacts of your build. You are Elon Musk...anything is possible!
