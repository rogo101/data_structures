Congratulations! You succeeded. Tesla is now the most popular car in America. The first city on Mars, appropriately named ElonVille, has just been founded and appointed you as mayor. And people no longer try to develop sentient AI's thanks to your admonitions. What do you want to do now? You are old and frail, so retiring is probably the best course of action. But you're not the next Lebron James yet so you still have one more hurdle to overcome.

Forget about it. You are the king and its time to live like one.
